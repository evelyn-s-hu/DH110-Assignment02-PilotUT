# Pilot UT for the Washington State Department of Ecology Website
**Author:** Evelyn Hu  
**Course:** DH110 User Interface and Design  
**Description:** A pilot usability test for the website of the Washington State Department of Ecology

## Introduction of Washington State Department of Ecology website
purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of your heuristic evaluation


The usability test consisted of the following steps:
- Intro
- Background questions
- Previous experience questions
- Pre-test questions
- Tasks
- Post-test questions
- SUS questionnaire
- Product satisfaction cards
- Demographics
<br>
The usability aimed to measure how the user felt regarding ease of use, trustworthiness, site organization and content, and general feelings upon using the website.  
Zoom and its recording function was used to capture footage of the participant's experience going through and thoughts of the website.

## Post-UT Reflection
  Overall, the usability testing went very smoothly for the most part. As I grew more familiar with the website during my heuristic evaluation of it, I had to fight the urge to give hints and suggestions to the user when he had difficulty finding certain steps in each of the tasks. For the most part, the user did well on his own, but I did end up giving some hints when the user still struggled to find things on his own. However, the fact that I had to step in at certain points allows me to pinpoint where potential problems with the website may arise.  
  Throughout the pilot test, one thing that stood out to me the most was the fact that the tabs on the menu are not very descriptive. Although the user did well locating the things I asked him to, and thought himself that his experience was rather smooth, I believe that if the user could hover over the tabs on the menu and have a list of topics covered under that category show up, the process would be even smoother. Additionally, even though there were moments where the search bar would have come in handy, the user decided not to use it; perhaps it should be put in a more prominent position or made bigger and more obvious. As many suggestions for improvement in my heuristic evaluation surrounded the topic of the search bar, it was a little disappointing that my user did not use it during the usability testing. As a result, I believe more usability testing with a broader sample of people would be beneficial to collecting the feedback needed to improve this website efficiently.  
  One of the problems that I thought would be an issue in my heuristic evaluation were the lack of "back" buttons implemented on the website. Because my user for this pilot is more tech-savvy, he was able to use the back button on his browser; however, as this is a government website, we should keep in mind that not all users may be as tech-savvy as my user in this test. Therefore, I still think that this is something that would not hurt the website if it were to be implemented, and still recommend that it be implemented despite my user not running into this issue.
